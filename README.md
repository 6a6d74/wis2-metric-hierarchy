# WIS2 monitoring and metric hierarchy

## Overview

This repository defines the metrics to be exposed by Global Services (see: metrics), precomputed metrics (see: rules) and alert rules for the Global Monitor (see: alerts)

The WIS2 Global Monitoring fetches metrics from all WIS2 Global Services, precomputes the defined metrics and generates alerts based on the defined alerting rules.
